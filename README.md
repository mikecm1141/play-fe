# Play - React Front-End

## Description/Purpose

This project was originally written in raw JavaScript using the jQuery
library. It communciates with a back-end written using the Express framework
with Node JS. You can find these aforementioned projects below:

 * [Back-End](https://github.com/mikecm1141/play-api)
 * [Old Front-End](https://github.com/mikecm1141/play-js)

## Technologies

This project is written using the React library, along with Redux for state
management, Redux-Saga for API management, and React Router.

## Project Notes

This project I did not follow the best commit procedures. Looking bad this is
somewhat of a regret of mine, but I did try and commit still regularly with
similar changes in each one.

The UI design was changed somewhat from the original version, as this project was
less about the design and more about implementing this project in a React environment.

## Contributors

with design by [Daniel Mulitauopele](https://github.com/DanielMulitauopele/).
